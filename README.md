### **What Is a Recommendation Engine?**
A recommendation engine is a data filtering tool that use machine learning algorithms to suggest the most relevant products to a certain user or customer. It works on the premise of identifying patterns in customer behavior data, which can be collected either implicitly or explicitly.

### **What Sorts of Recommendation Engines Are All there?**
Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a mix of the two are the three main types of recommendation engines.

### **Content-Baesd Filtering**
Content-based filtering works on the principle that if you like a particular item, you will also like this other item. To make recommendations, algorithms use a profile of the customerâ€™s preferences and a description of an item (genre, product type, color, word length) to work out the similarity of items using cosine and Euclidean distances. 

### **Collaborative Filtering**
Collaborative filtering is the process of gathering and analysing data on user behaviour, activities, and preferences in order to forecast what a user will like based on their similarities to other users. Collaborative filtering use a matrix-style method to plot and calculate these similarities.
