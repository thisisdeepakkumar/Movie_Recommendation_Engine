# Movie Recommendation Engine
The code for building a movie recommendation system could be found in this repository.

## **What Is a Recommendation Engine?**
A recommendation engine is a data filtering tool that use machine learning algorithms to suggest the most relevant products to a certain user or customer. It works on the premise of identifying patterns in customer behavior data, which can be collected either implicitly or explicitly.

## **What Sorts of Recommendation Engines Are All there?**
Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a mix of the two are the three main types of recommendation engines.

### **Content-Baesd Filtering**
Content-based filtering works on the principle that if you like a particular item, you will also like this other item. To make recommendations, algorithms use a profile of the customerâ€™s preferences and a description of an item (genre, product type, color, word length) to work out the similarity of items using cosine and Euclidean distances. 

### **Collaborative Filtering**
Collaborative filtering is the process of gathering and analysing data on user behaviour, activities, and preferences in order to forecast what a user will like based on their similarities to other users. Collaborative filtering use a matrix-style method to plot and calculate these similarities.

### **Hybrid Model**
A hybrid recommendation engine considers both meta (collaborative) and transactional (content-based) data when making recommendations. As a result, it outperforms both.

## **How Does a Recommendation Engine Work?**
A recommendation engine uses a combination of data and machine learning technologies to make recommendations. Data is critical in the creation of a recommendation engine since it is the foundation from which patterns are created. It will be more efficient and effective in making appropriate revenue-generating ideas if it has more data.

Recommendation engines execute a four-step operation:

Step 1: Data collection
- Implicit Data 
- Explicit Data

Step 2: Data storage
Step 3: Data analysis 
- Real-time analysis: Data is processed in real time.
- Batch analysis: Data is handled on a regular basis.
- Near real time analysis: When data isn't needed right away, it's analysed in minutes rather than seconds.
